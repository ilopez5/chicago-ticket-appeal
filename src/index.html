	<!--  Statistics about 25th ward tickets here  -->



	<h2>What to do about your ticket</h2>
	<p>Appeal! Only 9% of tickets issued in the 25th ward between Jan. 1, 2013 and Dec. 31, 2017 were contested. However, 60% of those appeals resulted in the ticket being thrown out.</p>
	<p>There is no fee to request an administrative hearing, and no penalty if you lose. Once you request a hearing, you will receive a week during which to appear at a hearing facility. You can go anytime during that week, based on your availability.</p>
	<p>Our site contains information to help you understand the appeal process, prepare your case, and contest your ticket confidently. Go to our <a href="defenses.html">allowable defenses</a> page to learn how you can defend yourself. Use our <a href="prepare.html">preparation</a> page to build your case and prepare your evidence. You can also view a list of other helpful sites in our <a href="resources.html">resources</a></p>
