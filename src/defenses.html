		<h1>Allowable Defenses</h1>

		<p>You have seven (7) days from the date of issuance of a parking or compliance violation to contest the ticket. If neither a contest or payment is received, a second Notice of Violation is mailed allowing twenty-one (21) days to request a hearing.</p>

			<h2>Parking/Compliance Violations</h2>
			<ul>
				<li>
					<strong>You didn’t own the car at the time, or you had leased your car to someone else, and provided the name and address of that person within 60 days of being notified, following <a href="https://codelibrary.amlegal.com/codes/chicago/latest/chicago_il/0-0-0-2488967">these rules in the city code.</a></strong>
					<ul>
						<li class="italic">Evidence Example(s):</li>
						<li>Proof of sale to someone else before the parking violation occurred.</li>
						<li>Proof of purchasing the car after the parking violation occurred.</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
				<li>
					<strong>The car that was ticketed was stolen or had stolen plates.</strong>
					<ul>
						<li class="italic">Evidence Example(s):</li>
						<li>Police report for the stolen car or plates, dated before the violation.</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
				<li>
					<strong>The signs with parking regulations were covered or missing.</strong>
					<ul>
						<li class="italic">Evidence Example(s):</li>
						<li>Pictures including your car (with the ticket on the windshield) exactly as it was found.</li>
						<li>Pictures including your car and the signs (or where they should be) on the side of the street you parked, showing that they are unreadable.</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
				<li>
					<strong>The parking meter was not working properly.</strong>
					<ul>
						<li class="italic">Evidence Example(s):</li>
						<li>This could be difficult to prove, since it’s difficult to show a malfunctioning meter. However a clear record of the steps you took to try to use the meter, the time at which you called to report the meter as broken, or a video of the meter could be enough to convince the judge that the meter wasn’t working.</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
				<li>
					<strong>Based on the facts stated in the violation, you didn’t actually break the rule you are accused of breaking. For example, you were ticketed for not having a city sticker, but you’ve lived in Chicago for less that 30 days (or purchased the car less than 30 days before). Or, your tinted windows comply with the medical use requirement.</strong>
					<ul>
						<li class="italic">Evidence Example(s):</li>
						<li>Your lease agreement showing the date you became a resident of Chicago was less than 30 days before the city sticker violation.</li>
						<li>Proof that you bought the car less than 30 days before the city sticker violation.</li>
						<li>Certified letter from your physician stating that you require specially tinted windows because of a medical condition (under <a href="https://www.ilga.gov/legislation/ilcs/fulltext.asp?DocName=062500050K12-503">part (g) of this section of the Illinois Vehicle Code</a>).</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
				<li>
					<strong>The facts in the violation you received are not true. For example, your car was not parked illegally when the violation was issued.</strong>
					<ul>
						<li class="italic">Evidence Example(s):</li>
						<li>Photos of the car when it was ticketed.</li>
						<li>A diagram of the area to accompany the photos might be helpful as well.</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
				<li>
					<strong>You have fixed the compliance issue you were ticketed for. There are exceptions: you cannot argue this if your compliance issue was for a city sticker (<a href="https://codelibrary.amlegal.com/codes/chicago/latest/chicago_il/0-0-0-2487490">section of city code</a>), an exhaust problem violating part (a)(2) of <a href="https://codelibrary.amlegal.com/codes/chicago/latest/chicago_il/0-0-0-2488264">this section</a>, registration plate problems violating part (a)(2) or (f) of <a href="https://codelibrary.amlegal.com/codes/chicago/latest/chicago_il/0-0-0-2488283">this section</a>, or glass coverings/coatings violating <a href="https://codelibrary.amlegal.com/codes/chicago/latest/chicago_il/0-0-0-2488321">this section</a>.</strong>
					<ul>
						<li class="italic">Evidence Example(s):</li>
						<li>Receipt or invoice from the repair shop dated after the violation that shows your compliance issue was fixed.</li>
