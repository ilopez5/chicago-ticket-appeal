		<h1>Allowable Defenses</h1>

			<h2>Parking/Compliance Violations</h2>
			<ul>
				<li>You didn’t own the car at the time, or you had leased your car to someone else, and provided the name and address of that person within 60 days of being notified, following <a href="https://codelibrary.amlegal.com/codes/chicago/latest/chicago_il/0-0-0-2488967">these rules in the city code.</a></li>
				<li>The car that was ticketed was stolen or had stolen plates.</li>
				<li>The signs with parking regulations were covered or missing.</li>
				<li>The parking meter was not working properly.</li>
				<li>Based on the facts stated in the violation, you didn’t actually break the rule you are accused of breaking. For example, you were ticketed for not having a city sticker, but you’ve lived in Chicago for less that 30 days (or purchased the car less than 30 days before). Or, your tinted windows comply with the medical use requirement.</li>
				<li>The facts in the violation you received are not true. For example, your car was not parked illegally when the violation was issued.</li>
				<li>You have fixed the compliance issue you were ticketed for. There are exceptions: you cannot argue this if your compliance issue was for a city sticker (<a href="https://codelibrary.amlegal.com/codes/chicago/latest/chicago_il/0-0-0-2487490">section of city code</a>), an exhaust problem violating part (a)(2) of <a href="https://codelibrary.amlegal.com/codes/chicago/latest/chicago_il/0-0-0-2488264">this section</a>, registration plate problems violating part (a)(2) or (f) of <a href="https://codelibrary.amlegal.com/codes/chicago/latest/chicago_il/0-0-0-2488283">this section</a>, or glass coverings/coatings violating <a href="https://codelibrary.amlegal.com/codes/chicago/latest/chicago_il/0-0-0-2488321">this section</a>.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>You have twenty-one (21) days from the Notice of Violation date to contest the issuance of an automated traffic law enforcement (i.e. red light) or automated speed camera enforcement violation.</p>
