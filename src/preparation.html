		<h1>Preparing Your Appeal</h1>

			<p>A notice will be mailed to you noting the begin date of the week you can appear at any of the City of Chicago's hearing facilities during the hours noted below.

		</section>

		<section id="what-to-expect">
			<h2>What to Expect at a Hearing</h2>

			<p>All visitors to a hearing facility must go through security, so do not bring any weapons, food, or drink. Upon arriving to the hearing facility, go to the room that is indicated on your Notice of Violation or Notice of Hearing. Ask staff for directions if there is no room indicated.</p>

			<p>During the hearing, the hearing officer will give opening remarks detailing the hearing process. The city will first present its case against you as detailed in the sworn Notice of Violation. The city may or may not call witnesses or offer other documents of evidence; in the case of a parking violation, this is unlikely.</p>

			<p>The hearing officer verifies if the city has properly presented its case, and if it has, the hearing will proceed to allow you to present your case. Using the template below, you may present your testimony and offer your documents of evidence.</p>

			<p>Afterwards, the hearing officer will make a decision by taking all evidence on both sides into account; <strong>thus, it is vital that you provide necessary evidence to support your case!</strong> If you succeed in defending yourself and are not found liable, then the hearing officer will dismiss the case and all penalties of the violation will no longer be imposed.</p>

			<h2>Court Statement Template</h2>

			<p>The following template may serve as a guideline for your verbal defense in court. <a href="assets/pdf/template.pdf">Download this template as a pdf</a>.</p>

			<div id="appeal-template">
				<p>Your Honor,</p>

				<p>My name is <strong>(full name)</strong> and I received a ticket for <strong>(type of violation)</strong> on <strong>(date of violation)</strong>. I am contesting the ticket based on the following evidence:</p>

				<p><strong>(Provide a defense for your appeal with evidence. <a href="defenses.html">Here is a full list of allowable defenses</a>.)</strong></p>

				<ul>
					<li>
						<strong>Example defense: The car was stolen at the time</strong>
						<p>The vehicle mentioned in the report was stolen on January 12th. I have brought with me the police report. It shows that the car was reported stolen before this violation took place on January 14th.</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<strong>Example defense: The sign prohibiting parking was covered</strong>
						<p>I received a ticket because my car was parked in an area that required a residential parking permit. However, all of the signs indicating this were covered in graffiti. When I returned to my car and saw the ticket on the windshield, I took pictures of the surrounding area to show this. I will now present these pictures to the court. As you can see, there were no readable signs anywhere near my car when I parked it there.</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<strong>Example defense: Based on the facts in the ticket, you didn’t break any rules</strong>
						<p>I received a ticket for parking on the East side of Wallace Street on a Tuesday. Parking is prohibited on Tuesdays due to street cleaning. However, the sign clearly indicates that this prohibition ends at 5pm. The time of the violation, as stated on the ticket, was 6:12pm. I was allowed to park there at that time.</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<strong>Example defense: The facts stated in the ticket aren’t true</strong>
						<p>I received a ticket for parking within 15 feet of a fire hydrant. However, my vehicle was more than 15 feet away from the closest fire hydrant. I have a series of photos I took of the street and my car to show that my car was not within 15 feet of the hydrant. I will now present these photos to the court. As you can see, my vehicle was several car lengths away from the hydrant, well over 15 feet.</p>
					</li>
				</ul>

				<p>Based on the evidence I have presented, I have shown that I am not liable for the ticket I received.</p>

				<p>Thank you for your time, Your Honor.</p>
