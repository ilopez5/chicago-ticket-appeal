## Description
The goal of this project is to provide a resource for citizens of Chicago's 25th
Ward so that they may contest parking and compliance tickets. Included is source
code for a website (which provides these resources, encouraging statistics, and
defense templates), a handout/flyer with the brief summary and link to our
website, and any associated data analysis files (i.e., R).
